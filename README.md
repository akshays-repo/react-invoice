This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## react-invoice
I've built this app for in-browser quick invoice creation.

```
npm i && npm start 
```

Once installed and opened in browser, click LOGO and you'll be able to edit all fields.
After you've filled out the necessary information, click logo again to preview and print to pdf if satisfied. Done!
